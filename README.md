same old telepot, just doesn't break with polls which didn't exist back in the day and nick lee no longer wants to maintain this

replace ```telepot``` in your requirements with ```git+https://github.com/sarpulas/telepot.git```

it still won't process polls, who needs that garbage, but at least our bots will keep working
